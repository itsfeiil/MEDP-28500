				<p>A <b>square</b> is a regular polygon with four equal sides and equal angles that each measure 90°. For a quick refresher, a regular polygon is a two-dimensional enclosed figure made by joining three or more straight lines. You come across squares every day, and you might not even realize it! Everyday items like picture frames, sticky notes, and pizza boxes are just a few examples out of hundreds. A square is a special type of quadrilateral that has unique properties. Understanding these properties is crucial in various areas of mathematics, including geometry and algebra. </p>
