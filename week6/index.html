			<h2>What is quadrilateral shapes</h2>

				<p>A <i>quadrilateral</i> is a closed shape and a type of polygon that has four sides, four vertices and four angles. It is formed by joining four non-collinear points. The sum of interior angles of quadrilaterals is always equal to 360 degrees. The word quadrilateral is derived from the Latin words ‘Quadra’ which means four and ‘Latus’ means ‘sides’. <strong>It is not necessary that all the four sides of a quadrilateral are equal in length.</strong> Hence, we can have different types of quadrilaterals based on sides and angles. </p>

				<p>One example of a <i>quadrilateral</i> will be <b>squares</b>. 
					<br> A square has equal sides (marked "s") and every angle is a right angle (90°). Also opposite sides are parallel. A square also fits the definition of a rectangle (all angles are 90°), and a rhombus (all sides are equal length).

				<p>Another example of a <i>quadrilateral</i> will be <b>rectangles</b>. 
					<br> A rectangle is a four-sided shape where every angle is a right angle (90°). Also opposite sides are parallel and of equal length. The opposite sides of the rectangle are equal in length which makes it different from a square.

			<h3>Similarities</h3>
			<p>Square and rectangle are examples of two-dimensional shapes. They both fall under the category of quadrilaterals. </p>
			<h3>Differences</h3>
			<p>A square is a closed plane figure with four equal sides and four vertices forming four interior right angles. In contrast, a rectangle is a closed plane figure with four straight sides and four vertices forming four interior right angles.</p>
			<h3>Cool Facts</h3>
			<p>A square has a larger area than all other quadrilaterals with the same perimeter. The diagonals of a square bisect each other at 90 degrees and are perpendicular. Opposite sides of a square are parallel. The internal angles of a square add to 360 degrees.</p>
