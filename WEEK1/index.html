<h3>
	ABOUT ME
</h3>

My name is Xiaofei Liu. Preferred name will be Fei which is pronounced the same as “Fay”. My pronouns are she/her. I am a senior student in Hunter College and expecting to graduate in May 2025. I’m currently living in Queens, New York right now and will be for the future. I was born and raised in China for 10 years. Me and my family decided to move to the United States to seek a different life experience and more job opportunities.

<h3>
	STATEMENT
</h3>

I have always been interested in things related to the art field such as: drawing, dancing, singing and alot more. Even though I’m interested in multiple fields, dance is stilI the main thing I focus and spend most time on. I have had many dance cover projects with my dance crew and most of them were done in Times Square, the most well-known place in New York city.

<h3>
	GOALS FOR THE COURSE
</h3>

Now being a media major, I’m looking forward to gaining more digital knowledge on coding, photoshopping, new media writing, etc. In this course of web production, by the end of the semester I hope I can build a perfect website that includes texts, good themes and being aesthetic. Other than this, I would also like to improve my html coding skills using tools such as the sublime text.
