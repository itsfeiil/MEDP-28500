				<h1>Interests</h1>
				<p>I have always been interested in things related to the art field such as: drawing, dancing, singing and alot more. Even though I’m interested in multiple fields, dance is stilI the main thing I focus and spend most time on. I have had many dance cover projects with my dance crew and most of them were done in Times Square, the most well-known place in New York city.</p>

				<h1>Goals</h1>
				<p>Now being a media major, I’m looking forward to gaining more digital knowledge on coding, photoshopping, new media writing, etc. In this course of web production, by the end of the semester I hope I can build a perfect website that includes texts, good themes and being aesthetic. Other than this, I would also like to improve my html coding skills using tools such as the sublime text.</p>
