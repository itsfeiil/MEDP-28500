			<h2>What is it</h2>
			<p>Red Velvet Brownies are the perfect combination of fudgy brownies and red velvet cake. Red Velvet Cake was originated in the South of the USA during the Great Depression. The best part of Red Velvet Cake is the tanginess you get from the buttermilk and vinegar. It is "The Brownie” of New York for over 50 years, made with Greenberg’s custom blend of fudgy red velvet with a thick ribbon of luscious cheesecake. With a striking red crumb and a thick layer of luxurious cream cheese frosting on top, they are a delicious anytime treat. These red velvet brownies will satisfy two sweet tooth cravings at once!</p>
